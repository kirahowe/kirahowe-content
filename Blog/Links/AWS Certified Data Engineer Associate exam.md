I always wonder how useful these types of exams are in practice. It often seems like they're mostly not very applicable to "real" work, but this one (and the associated Coursera courses) seem well constructed and practical.

I started a new job a couple of months ago that's much more like what this course describes as "data engineering" than the type of software engineering I'm used to and I have become painfully aware of how little I know about the "cloud" and all the various hosted services for working with data. This course feels different than other ones I've come across so far in that it appears to focus on very hands-on and realistic types of work, and notably also tasks that are very similar to what I'm actually doing day to day now. I think it could actually be very useful to pursue.
