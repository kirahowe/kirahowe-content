This is a great book that appears to mirror much of the content from the [Fundamentals of Data Engineering book by Joe Reis and Matt Housley](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/). I'm finding it really satisfying this week digging more into the distinctions between data engineering, data science, data analysis, software engineering, and everything in between. I started out in very standard software development roles, building rails apps for various companies. My roles over the last few years have been decidedly _not_ typical web development ones, but I'm never quite sure how exactly to explain what I do best. I feel like I'm finally on to something with all of this data engineering stuff.
