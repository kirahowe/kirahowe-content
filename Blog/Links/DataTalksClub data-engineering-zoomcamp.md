I know reddit is a real mixed bag, but I often find good information there. It seems like it's one of the last remaining places on the internet that's not dominated by SEO-optimized or AI-generated hooey. I started the Coursera course associated with the [[AWS Certified Data Engineer Associate exam]] and was looking for recommendations for more learning resources when I came across this. I haven't started it yet so I'm not sure how good it is, but in the past I've had a great time learning a lot from these types of community-made resources. I'm looking forward to checking it out.

It's also the first time I've ever heard of the [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub). I don't know anything about it but it's github profile makes it seem like type of online community I absolute love. I am super passionate about creating free learning resources for technologies I'm interested in and really admire people who have had success doing that in their own niches. I'm excited to join this community and see what happens!
