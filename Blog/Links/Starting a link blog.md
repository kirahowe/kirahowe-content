One of my favourite blogs on the internet is [Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net). I recently read this post of his about link blogging and love the idea. I occasionally post longer-form articles or essays on my blog, but usually only one or two per month, and I have a totally chaotic and unorganized web of ways to keep track of other interesting things I'm learning about or doing, but a lot of them are things I would love to share or connect with other people about.

I think his style of blogging is a great fit for the ways I use the internet and keep track of notes. I'm [[Yet another website reboot|already working on]] refreshing my website (again), and I think this way of thinking about what to publish and how will really work for me. I'm still the authoring experience of writing in Obsidian, and I find the built-in daily notes functionality makes it really easy to keep things organized. Now I just have to turn all the content into a website :) I'd like to also eventually migrate all of my various prior attempts at blogging, at least on technical topics, to this system so it's all in one place.
