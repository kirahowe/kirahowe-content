I had a super interesting conversation with Ananth Packkildurai of [Data Engineering Weekly](https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/data-engineering-weekly-202) today and a couple of interesting tools came up. One was this: [dltHub](https://dlthub.com). There are a lot of people trying to solve some of the main pain points in data engineering, and I'm convinced (like Ananth) that functional languages and approaches to software engineering have a lot to offer in solving them. This tool in particular appears to attempt to automate away some of the painful parts of the process, and I'm super curious to explore their approach. It seems like a really hard thing to do well. The problem of extracting data from traditional sources (DBs, files, APIs) and moving it elsewhere is well solved, but it's the increasingly complex transformations, large volumes, and disparate end use cases that are causing the strain with the current standard data stack.
